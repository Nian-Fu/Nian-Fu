## Hi there 👋

 I'm funian, a tech enthusiast passionate about the frontier development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Embodied Intelligence.

With a diverse range of hobbies, I enjoy playing the guitar and singing to unwind, as well as running to stay energetic. As a humorous soul who loves writing, I focus on documenting my personal growth journey and sharing in-depth analyses of practical technical tools through my content.

Feel free to explore my repositories for project demos, learning notes, and tool reviews. Let's connect and discuss AI innovations or tech insights together!
